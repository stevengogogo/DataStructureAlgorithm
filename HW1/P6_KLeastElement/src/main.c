 * @brief DSA2021 HW1 P6: K least member. This package is majorly done by myself. The algorithm part is inspired by Zeng Zi-Yan (Thursday TA). The quick sort algorithm is inspired by GreekforGeek, and I have cited the reference in comment. Please see [Project Website](https://stevengogogo.github.io/DSA-KLeastElement/) for the details.
