## Highlights of Requirements

### Submission

> The PDF file for the non-programming part should be submitted to Gradescope as in- structed, and you should use Gradescope to tag the pages that correspond to each sub- problem to facilitate the TAs’ grading. Failure to tagging the correct pages of the sub- problem can cause losing part or all of the scores on the subproblem.

### Format
> For problems in the non-programming part, you should combine your solutions in ONE PDF file. Your file should generally be legible with a white/light background—using white/light texts on a dark/black background is prohibited. Your solution must be as simple as possible. At the TAs’ discretion, solutions which are too complicated will be regarded as incorrect. Moreover, if you would like to use any theorem which is not mentioned in the classes, please include its proof in your solution.

### Credits

> Discussions on course materials and homework solutions are encouraged. But you should write the final solutions alone and understand them fully. Books, notes, and Internet resources can be consulted, but not copied from. For each non-programming problem, you have to specify the references (the Internet URL you consulted with or the people you

> Discussed with) on the first page of your solution for that problem; for each programming problem, you have to specify the references on the first lines (comments) of your code (main.c) for that problem.
